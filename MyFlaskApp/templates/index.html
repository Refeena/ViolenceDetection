<h1>Detect Violence in video</h1>
<p  >This project implements MobileNet model,
in combination with
LSTM detecting violent scenes in a video stream
This project proposes a new deep learning model that uses the concept of transfer learning for violence
detection and also identifies the aggressive individuals by learning the detailed features in the videos.
The features extracted from the MobileNet pre-trained model proved to be effective for detecting violence. MobileNet model,
in combination with LSTM, yielded an accuracy of 94.4% and thereby, proving its superiority over other experimented ImageNet models. </p>
